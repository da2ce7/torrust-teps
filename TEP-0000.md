## Abstract

The abstract should be a short description of what the TEP will achieve.

## Detailed description

This section describes the need for the TEP. It should describe the existing problem that it is trying to solve and why this TEP makes the situation better. It should include examples of how the new functionality would be used and perhaps some use cases.

## Implementation

This section lists the major steps required to implement the TEP. Where possible, it should be noted where one step is dependent on another, and which steps may be optionally omitted. Where it makes sense, each step should include a link related pull requests as the implementation progresses.

Any pull requests or development branches containing work on this TEP should be linked to from here. (A TEP does not need to be implemented in a single pull request if it makes sense to implement it in discrete phases).

## Backward compatibility Break points

This section describes the ways in which the TEP breaks backward compatibility.

## Alternatives

If there were any alternative solutions to solving the same problem, they should be discussed here, along with a justification for the chosen approach.

## Discussion

This section may just be a bullet list including links to any discussions regarding the TEP:

This includes links to mailing list threads or relevant GitHub issues.

## Auxiliary Files

List of files for support and clarification of the TEP. List files with their relative links.

## References and Footnotes
