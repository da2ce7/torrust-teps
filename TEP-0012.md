# Introduction

## Abstract
This document proposes the use of asymmetric cryptography for user accounts and their authentication.

## Copyright
This document is licensed under the 2-clause BSD license. 

## Motivation
Currently Torrust uses traditional password-username based authentication:

* For every user the server stores a username, salt, and hashed password.
* To login, the client sends their username and password to the server.
* The server looks up the username and gets the salt, salts and hashes the supplied password, and compares it with the hashed password on record.
* If matching, the client is authenticated as that user.

Asymmetric authentication has a number of advantages when compared to password authentication, (assuming the client software is honest):
* No need to send any secret data to the server. In contrast, (hashed and salted) passwords that have to be protected from leakage and misuse.
* Synchronization of user-accounts in a group of federated servers becomes much safer: Instead of sharing hashed-passwords between the servers, (or using some centralized authentication service), the servers only need to synchronise the public-keys, without the risk of leaking secret-data.

The disadvantage:
* The user no longer picks their own password, instead a private key is generated for the user's client software, this key is 32-bytes long and impossible to remember.  If the user looses this code, they loose access to their account.

This disadvantage is mitigated by providing the user with a 'backup seed' when they generate their private key, that the user can use to recover their private key.

# Design
We first describe the database and user-structure, and general protocols, then we specify clients generating new private keys, and finally describe the public key authentication protocol.

## Overview
New Users:
1. Client generates secret keys, and derives public key.
2. Client and server preform the Diffie-Hellman authentication protocol.
3. Client creates username, and the public key is associated the username.

Existing Users:
1. Client and server preform the Diffie-Hellman authentication protocol.
2. Client selects username that it wishes to login with.

(There may be more than one username that is associated with the same public key).

## Users
A username is the unique key in the database retaining to the actions of a user. Public keys are associated with users, for a particular purpose. Every public-key-purpose combination has a set of timed status.

```
[user]
(PK. String) username

[purposed_public_key]
(PK. public_key || purpose)
(Enum.) purpose
(Binary.) 32-byte-public_key

[status_timed]
(PK. Unique Hashed)
(Enum.) status
(Date-Time. Optional.) beginning
(Date-Time. Optional.) end

[user] many-many [purposed_public_key]

[user][purposed_public_key] many [status_timed]
```

_"Users and Purposed-Public-Keys have a many-many association, each association may associate many timed statuses.":_
- Each _user_ may look up what _purposed public keys_ it is associated with.</br>
Likewise, Each _purposed public key_ may look up what _users_ it is associated with.
- Each _(user <> purposed public key)_ link can look up it's associated _timed statuses_.

### Purposes
In this document we only user the `A` for "Authentication".</br>In the future we may propose additional purposes.
```
Purposes (enum):

A: Authentication
```

### Status Validity
If revocation does not specify a beginning, it is for all time periods.</br>
`Active` has the lowest priority: The key must be `created`, and not `expired`, and not `revoked`.
```
Status (enum):

A: Active
C: Created
E: Expired
R: Revoked
```
#### Status Validity Table:
|status|beginning|end|
|:-|:-|:-|
|active|must|must|
|created|must|none|
|expired|must|none|
|revoked|optional|none|

# Specification
The server maintains a list of public keys that may be used for authentication for each user. A user may propose a new public key be added to their list of authentication keys, or may revoke or expire an existing key.

* To add, or expire, or increase the active period a public key, the user must first authenticate with this new key to prove ownership.
* To revoke, the user may authenticate with the key they wish to revoke.</br>
Or some other form of authentication should be used in the case that the user no-longer has access to their secret key, such as verification by a moderator.

Users who do not have any public key associated, for example new users, or when transitioning from password based authentication should first authenticate with their public key, then preform the association with the user account.

## Mnemonic Codes
Clients generate a mnemonic code according to: [BIP-39](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039.mediawiki).

The seed words are prefixed with an additional `"torrust"` word, and displayed to the user. The 'torrust' seed word is not included in the checksum calculation, however must be present when the user enters their seed in recovery.

Clients must provide an option for the user to give a seed-password in generation and recovery.

### Storage of Mnemonic Code
The client should delete from memory the recovery seed once the user has confirmed that they have backed up the seed, and their key-pair(s) have been generated.

This gives the user some forward security. In the future the user may wish to use the same seed to rotate their keys (for example, when logging in on a new computer). Because the seed is not saved in the client, if the users' client is compromised at a later date, the seed itself remains secret.

## Public and Private Key Derivation
Deriving the keys according to: [BIP-32](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0032.mediawiki).

We use the following hardened derivation path:</br>The index is increased in the case the user has rotated their keys, for the moment we only use zero:
```
m / purpose' / version' / torrust-purpose' / index'

m / "torrust" / 0 / "authentication" / 0
```
The resulting node is a private-public secp256k1 key-pair. (the same elliptical-curve as is used in bitcoin).

___Note:__ as an extension, the future client may choose to derive and register a series of public keys with the server, i.e. indexes: 0, 1, 2, 3, etc, but delete all except the current key from memory.</br>
This will allow for easier key-rotation in the future, as additional keys cannot be predicted because we use hardened derivation._

### Storage of Derived Keys
In general, it is _not recommended_ that a general user would interact with any derived key material, such as the encoded login credentials. It is recommended that clients store this private data in their (long-term) _localStorage_.

- The client should provide an option to not use any long-term storage, but instead only use their (temporary) _sessionStorage_.
- The client should provide an option to view, backup and manually manage their derived keys.

There are three main reasons why we wish to provide these possibilities to the user:
1. _Public or Shared Computer Login:_ At internet caf√©'s or other places with shared computers.
2. _Multi-User-Account:_ Some users may wish to switch accounts on the same computer.
3. _Password-Manager Support:_ Some users prefer to use a password-manager.


## Login Credential Encoding
For encoding the secp256k1, we use [BIP-340](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0340.mediawiki) encoding, 32-bytes for public keys.</br>
For displaying the login credentials, we use [BIP-350](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0350.mediawiki), 'Bech32m' encoding.

We use the follwoing "Human Readable Parts", or "hrp":

|hrp|description|
|:-|:-|
|"torrust"|for public keys|
|"torrust_secret"|for secret keys|

Upon generation the public and secret keys are stored in the application (either the temporary _sessionStorage_ or the long-term _localStorage_) and may optionally be displayed to the user.

_If displayed to the user, the user should be encouraged to save them in their password manager._

```
Login ID:   bech32m("torrust",32-byte-public-key)
Login Code: bech32m("torauth",32-byte-private-key)
```

While technically only the private key is needed, we require both as the public key acts as checksum for the private key. This makes it more comfortable for users that are used to traditional password-username based authentication.

## Authentication
The server and client preform Elliptical Curve Diffie-Hellman over the secp256k1 curve to authenticate:

_We use the `secp256k1_ecdh` as defined in [secp256k1_ecdh.h](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/blob/master/include/secp256k1_ecdh.h), see example: [examples/ecdh.c](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/blob/master/examples/ecdh.c)._

___Note:__ This scheme assumes that there a secure client connection to the server, for example, by using TLS._

### Prerequisites
The server and client generate temporary ephemeral key pairs for every connection attempt. They should not be reused.
```
Ephemeral Keys:
(E_server, e_server)
(E_client, e_client)

Client User Key:
(U_client, u_server)
```

### Setup
The server transfers their ephemeral public key to the client.</br>
The client transfers their ephemeral public key and user public key to the server.
```
Server tx to Client:
(E_server)

Client tx to Server:
(E_client, U_client)
```

### Key Derive
The server and client both derive common secret keys.
```
Server:
ECDH(E_client, e_server) -> c_ephemeral
ECDH(U_client, e_server) -> c_user

Client:
ECDH(E_server, e_client) -> c_ephemeral
ECDH(E_server, u_client) -> c_user

Note: The resulting keys should be identical.
```

### Client Auth Token
The client includes their URI to help guard against man-in-the-middle attacks.
```
Shared RFC 3986 URI: format: "proto://[user@]host[:port][/path]"

HASH(uri_client || c_ephemeral || c_user) -> token_auth
```

### Authentication
The URI should match the expected domain of the server.
```
Client tx to Server:
(token_auth, uri_client)

Server Verify:
uri_client
token_auth

If matching, authorise user according to their user public key. (U_client).
```

_The server now can issue a session token to the client accordingly._

## Security Analysis

This scheme is very simple, it would be very good there was some formal security analysis.

The basic protocol follows:

1. Both derive a common ephemeral (temporary) key:</br>
`client_ephemeral (DH) server_ephemeral -> ephemeral_key`

_The ephemeral key is used as a nonce to protect against replay attacks._

2. Both derive a common authentication key:</br>
`client_public (DH) server_ephemeral -> authentication_key`

_Client knowledge of the authentication key implicitly shows ownership of the client public key._

3. Client derives the common authentication token:</br>
`server_uri + ephemeral_key + authentication_key -> authentication_token`

_Mixing in the server's uri helps protect the user from a bad-server impersonating another server._

4. Client sends URI and authentication token to server:</br>
`client: server_uri, authentication_token => server`

_The server does not learn of the ephemeral key and authentication key from the user. The server only learns the server uri and authentication token from the client._

_If the server was impersonating another server, the uri would not match._

5. Server checks `server_uri` matches expected value.

_This protects the client from the wrong server attack: if the user connects to `a.tld`, the uri will not match for `b.tdl`._

_Man in the middle attackers are unable to use an alternative uri._

6. Server also derives the common authentication token:</br>
`server_uri + ephemeral_key + authentication_key -> authentication_token`
 `authentication_token`

_This token includes the uri, nonce, and client public key._

7. Server checks the received `authentication_token` matches self-derived value.

_If the keys match, the client is authenticated for their client public key._

# Compatibility

The updated client will support both login in with the new authentication scheme, and transferring existing users with password authentication to the new scheme.

# Reference Implementations

## Similar Implementations
This scheme is so simple that I guess there should be!

However, the common ones that I have found are far-more complex than what we use here, (such as getting a CA involved with the authentication).
