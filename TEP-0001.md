## What is a TEP?

---

TEP stands for Torrust Enhancement Proposal.  A TEP is a design
document providing information to the Torrust community, or describing
a new feature for Torrust or its processes or environment.  The TEP
should provide a concise technical specification of the feature and a
rationale for the feature.

We intend TEPs to be the primary mechanisms for proposing major new
features, for collecting community input on an issue, and for
documenting the design decisions that have gone into Torrust.  The TEP
author is responsible for building consensus within the community and
documenting dissenting opinions.

Because the TEPs are maintained as md files in a versioned
repository, their revision history is the historical record of the
feature proposal. This historical record is available by the normal git
commands for retrieving older revisions.

## TEP Audience

---

The typical primary audience for TEPs are the core developers of the Torrust project and other contributors.

However, other parts of the Torrust community may also choose to use the process
(particularly for Informational TEPs) to document expected API conventions and
to manage complex design coordination problems that require collaboration across
multiple projects.

## TEP Types

---

There are three kinds of TEP:

1. A **Standards Track** TEP describes a new feature or implementation for Torrust.

2. An **Informational** TEP describes a Torrust design issue, or
   provides general guidelines or information to the Torrust community,
   but does not propose a new feature.  Informational TEPs do not
   necessarily represent a Torrust community consensus or
   recommendation, so users and implementers are free to ignore
   Informational TEPs or follow their advice.

3. A **Process** TEP describes a new process or change to an existing one for handling TEPs.

## TEP Workflow

### Torrust's Core Developers

---

There are several references in this TEP to "core developers". This refers to
the currently active Torrust core team members.

### TEP Editors

---

The TEP editors are individuals responsible for managing the administrative
and editorial aspects of the TEP workflow (e.g. assigning TEP numbers and changing their status).

TEP editors are members of the core developer team or trusted community members assigned to this task.

## Start with an idea for Torrust

---

The TEP process begins with a new idea for Torrust.

It is highly recommended that a single TEP contain a single key proposal or new idea; the more focused the TEP, the more successful it tends to be.

Most enhancements and bug fixes don't need a TEP and
can be submitted directly to their respective repository as an issue.

The TEP editors reserve the right to reject TEP proposals if they appear too unfocused or too broad.  

If in doubt, split your TEP into several well-focused ones.

Each TEP must have a champion -- someone who writes the TEP using the style and format described below, shepherds the discussions in the appropriate
forums, and attempts to build community consensus around the idea.  The TEP champion (a.k.a. Author) should first attempt to ascertain whether the idea is TEP-able.

Vetting an idea publicly before going as far as writing a TEP is meant to save the potential author time.

Asking the Torrust community first if an idea is original
helps prevent too much time being spent on something that is
guaranteed to be rejected based on prior discussions (searching
the internet does not always do the trick). It also helps to make sure the idea is applicable to the entire community and not just the author.

Just because an idea sounds good to the author does not
mean it will work for most people in most areas where Torrust is used.

Once the champion has asked the Torrust community as to whether an
idea has any chance of acceptance, a draft TEP should be presented to the appropriate venue mentioned above.

This gives the author a chance to flesh out the draft
TEP to make properly formatted, of high quality, and to address
initial concerns about the proposal.

### Submitting a TEP

---

Following the above initial discussion, the workflow varies based on whether
any of the TEP's co-authors are core developers. If one or more of the TEP's
co-authors are core developers, they are responsible for following the process
outlined below. Otherwise (i.e. none of the co-authors are core developers),
then the TEP author(s) will need to find a sponsor for the TEP.

The sponsor's job is to provide guidance to the TEP author to help them through the logistics of the TEP process (somewhat acting like a mentor).  

Being a sponsor does **not**
disqualify that person from becoming a co-author or TEP-Delegate later on (but
not both).  The sponsor of a TEP is recorded in the "Sponsor:" field of the
header.

Once the sponsor or the core developer(s) co-authoring the TEP deem the TEP
ready for submission, the proposal should be submitted as a draft TEP via a
`GitHub pull request`_.  The draft must be written in TEP style as described
below, else it will fail review immediately (although minor errors may be corrected by the editors).

The standard TEP workflow is:

- You, the TEP author, fork the `TEP repository`_, and create a file named
  ``TEP-9999.md`` that contains your new TEP.  Use "9999" as your draft TEP
  number.

- In the "Type:" header field, enter "Standards Track",
  or "Informational", as appropriate, and for the "Status:"
  field enter "Draft".  For full details, see `TEP Header Preamble`_.

- Push this to your GitHub fork and submit a pull request.

- The TEP editors review your PR for structure, formatting, and other errors.  

Approval criteria are:

    - It sound and complete.  The ideas must make technical sense.  The editors do not consider whether they seem likely to be accepted.
    - The title accurately describes the content.
    - The TEP's language (spelling, grammar, sentence structure, etc.) and code style (examples should match :TEP:`7` & :TEP:`8`) should be correct and conformant.  The TEP text will be automatically checked for correct reStructuredText formatting when the pull request is submitted.
    TEPs with invalid markup will not be approved.

  Editors are generally quite lenient about this initial review,
  expecting that problems will be corrected by the reviewing process.

  **Note:** Approval of the TEP is no guarantee that there are no
  embarrassing mistakes! Correctness is the responsibility of authors and reviewers, not the editors.

  If the TEP isn't ready for approval, an editor will send it back to the author for revision, with specific instructions.

- Once approved, they will assign your TEP a number.

Once the review process is complete, and the TEP editors approve it (note that this is *not* the same as accepting your TEP!), they will squash commit your pull request onto main.

The TEP editors will not unreasonably deny publication of a TEP.  Reasons for denying TEP status include duplication of effort, being technically unsound, not providing proper motivation or addressing backwards compatibility, or not in keeping with the Torrust philosophy.  

The Core Developer Team can be consulted during the approval phase, and is the final arbiter of a draft's TEP-ability.

Developers with write access to the `TEP repository`_ may claim TEP
numbers directly by creating and committing a new TEP. When doing so, the developer must handle the tasks that would normally be taken care of by the TEP editors. This includes ensuring the initial version meets the expected standards for submitting a
TEP.  

Alternately, even developers should submit TEPs via pull request.
When doing so, you are generally expected to handle the process yourself; if you need assistance from TEP editors state so in the PR.

As updates are necessary, the TEP author can check in new versions if they (or a collaborating developer) have write access to the `TEP repository`_.

Getting a TEP number assigned early can be useful for ease of
reference, especially when multiple draft TEPs are being considered at the same time.

Standards Track TEPs consist of two parts, a design document and a
reference implementation.  It is generally recommended that at least a prototype implementation be co-developed with the TEP, as ideas that sound good in principle sometimes turn out to be impractical when subjected to the test of implementation.

## Discussing a TEP

---

As soon as a TEP number has been assigned
and the draft TEP is committed to the `TEP repository`_,
a discussion thread for the TEP should be created
to provide a central place to discuss and review its contents, and the
TEP should be updated so that the ``Discussions-To`` header links to it.

The TEP authors (or sponsor, if applicable) may select any reasonable venue for the discussion, so long as the the following criteria are met:

- The forum is appropriate to the TEP's topic.
- The thread is publicly available on the web so that all interested parties can participate.
- The discussion is subject to the [Torrust Community Code of Conduct](https://github.com/torrust/.github/blob/main/info/code_of_conduct.md).
- A direct link to the current discussion thread is provided in the TEP under the ``Discussions-To`` header.

TEP authors are responsible for collecting community feedback on a TEP before submitting it for review. However, to avoid long-winded and open-ended discussions, strategies such as soliciting private or more narrowly-tailored feedback in the early design phase,
collaborating with other community members with expertise in the TEP's subject matter, and picking an appropriately-specialized discussion for the TEP's topic (if applicable) should be considered. TEP authors should use their discretion here.

Once the TEP is assigned a number and committed to the TEP repository, substantive issues should generally be discussed on the public discussion channels. This ensures everyone can follow and contribute, avoids fragmenting the discussion, and makes sure it is fully considered as part of the TEP review process.

Comments, support, concerns and other feedback on this designated thread are a critical part of will be considered when reviewing the TEP.

## TEP Review & Resolution

---

Once the authors have completed a TEP, they may request a review for style and consistency from the TEP editors.

However, content review and acceptance of the TEP is ultimately the
responsibility of Core Developers team once the authors (and sponsor, if any) determine the TEP is ready for final review and resolution.

To expedite the process in selected cases (e.g. when a change is clearly beneficial and ready to be accepted, but the TEP hasn't been formally submitted for review yet), the Core Developer Team may also initiate a TEP review, first
notifying the TEP author(s) and giving them a chance to make revisions.

The final authority for TEP approval is the Core Developer Team, whenever a new TEP is put forward, any core developer who believes they are suitably experienced to make the final decision on that TEP may offer to serve as its TEP-Delegate by `notifying the rest of the Core Developer team`of their intent.

If the rest of the Core Developer team approves their offer,
the TEP-Delegate will then have the authority to approve or reject that TEP.

If core developers (or other community members) have concerns
regarding the suitability of a TEP-Delegate for any given TEP, they may ask the Core Developer Team to review the delegation.

If no volunteer steps forward one of the Core Developer Team members will be assigned.

## TEP Minimum Criteria

---

For a TEP to be accepted it must meet certain minimum criteria.  It must be a clear and complete description of the proposed enhancement.

The enhancement must represent a net improvement.  The proposed
implementation, if applicable, must be solid and must not complicate the interpreter unduly.  Finally, a proposed enhancement must be "Torrustic" in order to be accepted by the Core Developer Team.  (However,
"Torrustic" is an imprecise term; it may be defined as whatever is acceptable to the Core Developer Team.  This logic is intentionally circular.)  

Except where otherwise approved by the Core Developer Team, Accepted and Rejected pronouncements of TEP resolution will be posted at the End of the README.

Once a TEP has been accepted, the reference implementation must be completed. When the reference implementation is complete and incorporated into the main source code repository, the status will be changed to "Final".

To allow gathering of additional design and interface feedback, a TEP may also be marked as "Provisional". This is short for "Provisionally Accepted", and indicates that the proposal has been accepted for inclusion in the reference
implementation, but additional user feedback is needed before the full design can be considered "Final".

Unlike regular accepted TEPs, provisionally accepted TEPs may still be Rejected or Withdrawn **even after the related changes have
been included in a Torrust release**.

Wherever possible, it is considered preferable to reduce the scope of a proposal to avoid the need to rely on the "Provisional" status (e.g. by deferring some features to later TEPs), as this status can lead to version compatibility
challenges in the wider Torrust ecosystem.

A TEP can also be assigned the status "Deferred".  The TEP author or an
editor can assign the TEP this status when no progress is being made on the TEP.  Once a TEP is deferred, a TEP editor can reassign it to draft status.

A TEP can also be "Rejected". Perhaps after all is said and done, it was not a good idea.  It is still important to have a record of this
fact. The "Withdrawn" status is similar - it means that the TEP author themselves has decided that the TEP is actually a bad idea, or has accepted that a competing proposal is a better alternative.

When a TEP is Accepted, Rejected or Withdrawn, the TEP should be updated accordingly in the Index and the README.

TEPs can also be superseded by a different TEP, rendering the original
obsolete.  This is intended for Informational TEPs, where version 2 of an API can replace version 1.

## TEP Maintenance

---

In general, TEPs are no longer substantially modified after they have reached
the Accepted, Final, Rejected or Superseded state.

Once resolution is reached,
a TEP is considered a historical document rather than a living specification. Formal documentation of the expected behavior should be maintained elsewhere.

If changes based on implementation experience and user feedback are made to
Standards track TEPs while in the Provisional or (with SC approval) Accepted
state, they should be noted in the TEP, such that the TEP accurately describes
the implementation at the point where it is marked Final.

Active (Informational and Process) TEPs may be updated over time to reflect
changes to development practices and other details. The precise process
followed in these cases will depend on the nature and purpose of the TEP
in question.

Occasionally, a Deferred or even a Withdrawn TEP may be resurrected
with major updates, but it is often better to just propose a new one.

## What belongs in a successful TEP?

---

Each TEP should have the following parts/sections as displayed in the [TEP-Template](/TEP-Template.md). which essentially the following:

1. Preamble

    Table containing meta-data about the    TEP, including the TEP number, a short descriptive title (limited
    to a maximum of 44 characters), the names, and optionally the
    contact info for each author, etc.

2. Abstract

    A short (~200 word) description of the technical issue being addressed.

3. Detailed Description

  A. Motivation -- The motivation is critical for TEPs that want to change the Torrust elements, or ecosystem.  It should clearly explain why some feature or implementation is inadequate to address the problem that the TEP solves. This can include collecting documented support from submitted issues or user requests. TEP submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected.

  B. Rationale -- The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing why particular design decisions were made.  It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work,e.g. how the feature is supported in other applications. The rationale should provide evidence of consensus within the community and discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.

4. Implementation

  A. Specification -- The technical specification should be detailed enough to allow competing, interoperable implementations for at least the current major Torrust release.

  B. Security Implications -- If there are security concerns in relation
   to the TEP, those concerns should be explicitly written out to make
   sure reviewers of the TEP are aware of them.

  C. How to Teach This -- For a TEP that adds new functionality or changes language behavior, it is helpful to include a section on how to teach users, new and experienced, how to apply the TEP to their work.

  This section may include key points and recommended documentation
  changes that would help users adopt a new feature or migrate their
  code to use a language change.

  D. Reference Implementation -- The reference implementation must be completed before any TEP is given status "Final", but it need not
  be completed before the TEP is accepted.  While there is merit
  to the approach of reaching consensus on the specification and
  rationale before writing code, the principle of "rough consensus
  and running code" is still useful when it comes to resolving many
  discussions of API details.

  The final implementation must include test code and documentation
  appropriate for either the Torrust language reference or the
  standard library reference.

5. Backward compatibility Break points

  All TEPs that introduce backwards
  incompatibilities must include a section describing these incompatibilities and their severity. The TEP must explain how the
  author proposes to deal with these incompatibilities. TEP
  submissions without a sufficient backwards compatibility treatise may be rejected outright.

6. Discussion

  A. Rejected Ideas -- Throughout the discussion of a TEP, various ideas
  will be proposed which are not accepted. Those rejected ideas should
  be recorded along with the reasoning as to why they were rejected.
  This both helps record the thought process behind the final version
  of the TEP as well as preventing people from bringing up the same
  rejected idea again in subsequent discussions.

  In a way this section can be thought of as a breakout section of the
  Rationale section that is focused specifically on why certain ideas
  were not ultimately pursued.

  B. Open Issues -- While a TEP is in draft, ideas can come up which warrant further discussion. Those ideas should be recorded so people know that they are being thought about but do not have a concrete resolution. This helps make sure all issues required for the TEP to be ready for consideration are complete and reduces people duplicating
  prior discussion.

7. References and Footnotes

 A collection of footnotes cited in the TEP, and a place to list non-inline hyperlink targets.

8. Copyright/license

  Each new TEP must be placed under the Torrust project approved license.

## TEP Formats and Templates

---

Here is the link to the [current template](/TEP-Template.md).

## TEP Header Preamble

---

Each TEP must begin with a header preamble. The headers must appear in the following order.  Headers marked with "*" are
optional and are described below.  All other headers are required.

.. code-block:: text

    TEP: TEP number
    Title: TEP title
    Author: list of authors' real names and optionally,  (GitHub Username)>
    *Sponsor: real name of sponsor (GitHub Username)
    *TEP-Delegate: TEP delegate's real name ( GitHub Username)
    Discussions-To: <URL of current canonical discussion thread>
    Status: <Draft | Active | Accepted | Provisional | Deferred | Rejected |
             Withdrawn | Final | Superseded>
    Type: Standards Track | Informational | Process
    *Requires: <TEP numbers>
    Created: <date created on, in dd-mmm-yyyy format
    Torrust-Version: version number
    Post-History: <dates, in dd-mmm-yyyy format,
                   inline-linked to TEP discussion threads>
    *Replaces: TEP number
    *Superseded-By: TEP number
    *Resolution: url

The Author header lists the names, and optionally the email addresses
of all the authors/owners of the TEP.  The format of the Author header
values must be:

```text
    Random J. User <random@example.com>
```

if the email address is included, and just:

```text
    Random J. User
```

if the address is not given.  For historical reasons the format
``random@example.com (Random J. User)`` may appear in a TEP;
however, new TEPs must use the mandated format above, and it is acceptable to
change to this format when TEPs are updated.

If there are multiple authors, they will be separated by",".

The Sponsor field records which developer (core, or otherwise approved by the Core Developer Team) is sponsoring the TEP.  If one of the authors of the TEP is a core developer, then no sponsor is necessary and thus this field should be left
out.

The TEP-Delegate field is used to record the individual appointed by the Core Developer Team to make the final decision on whether or not to approve or reject a TEP. (The delegate's email address is currently omitted due to a
limitation in the email address masking for reStructuredText TEPs)

The Discussions-To header provides the URL to the current canonical discussion thread for the TEP.
For email lists, this should be a direct link to the thread in the list's archives, rather than just a mailto: or hyperlink to the list itself.

The Type header specifies the type of TEP: Standards Track,
Informational, or Process.

The format of a TEP is specified with a Content-Type header.

The Created header records the date that the TEP was assigned a number, while Post-History is used to record the dates of and corresponding
URLs to the Discussions-To threads for the TEP, with the former as the linked text, and the latter as the link target.

Both sets of dates should be in ``yyyy-mm-dddd`` format, e.g. ``2022-08-16``.

Standards Track TEPs will typically have a Torrust-Version header which indicates the version of Torrust that the feature will be released with.

Standards Track TEPs without a Torrust-Version header indicate interoperability standards that will initially be supported through
external libraries and tools, and then potentially supplemented by a later TEP
to add support to the standard library. Informational and Process TEPs do
not need a Torrust-Version header.

TEPs may have a Requires header, indicating the TEP numbers that this TEP depends on.

TEPs may also have a Superseded-By header indicating that a TEP has been rendered obsolete by a later document; the value is the number of
the TEP that replaces the current document.  The newer TEP must have a Replaces header containing the number of the TEP that it rendered obsolete.

## Auxiliary Files

---

TEPs may include auxiliary files such as diagrams.  Such files should be named ``TEP-XXXX-Y.ext``, where "XXXX" is the TEP number, "Y" is a serial number (starting at 1), and "ext" is replaced by the actual file extension (e.g. "png").

Alternatively, all support files may be placed in a subdirectory called ``TEP-XXXX``, where "XXXX" is the TEP number. When using a subdirectory, there are no constraints on the names used in files.

## Changing Existing TEPs

---

Draft TEPs are freely open for discussion and proposed modification, at the discretion of the authors, until submitted to the Core Developer Team or TEP-Delegate for review and resolution. Substantive content changes should generally be first proposed on the TEP's discussion thread listed in its ``Discussions-To`` header, while copyedits and corrections can be submitted as a `GitHub issue` or `GitHub pull request`.

TEP authors with write access to the TEP repository can update the TEPs themselves by using ``git push`` or a GitHub PR to submit their changes.

For guidance on modifying other TEPs, consult the `TEP Maintenance` section.

See the `Contributing Guide` for additional details, and when in doubt, please check first with the TEP author and/or a TEP editor.

## Transferring TEP Ownership

---

It occasionally becomes necessary to transfer ownership of TEPs to a new champion.  In general, it is preferable to retain the original author as
a co-author of the transferred TEP, but that's really up to the original author. A good reason to transfer ownership is because the original author no longer has the time or interest in updating it or following through with the TEP process, or has fallen off the face of
the 'net (i.e. is unreachable or not responding to email).  A bad reason to transfer ownership is because the author doesn't agree with the
direction of the TEP.  One aim of the TEP process is to try to build consensus around a TEP, but if that's not possible, an author can always submit a competing TEP.

If you are interested in assuming ownership of a TEP, you can also do this via pull request.  Fork the `TEP repository`, make your ownership  modification, and submit a pull request.  You should mention both the original author and
``@Torrust/Core-Team`` in a comment on the pull request.  (If the original author's GitHub username is unknown, use email.)  If the original author doesn't respond in a timely manner, the Core Team will make a unilateral decision (it's not like such decisions can't be reversed :).

## Core Team Responsibilities & Workflow

---

A Core Team member must assume the responsibility to the `TEP repository`_.

Note that developers with write access to the `TEP repository` may handle the tasks that would normally be taken care of by the assigned Core Team member.

Alternately, even developers may request assistance from the responsible Core Team members by mentioning ``@Torrust/Core-Team`` on GitHub.

For each new TEP that comes in a responsible Core Team member does the following:

- Make sure that the TEP is either co-authored by a core developer, has a core developer as a sponsor, or has a sponsor specifically approved for this TEP by the Core Developer Team.
- Read the TEP to check if it is ready: sound and complete.  The ideas must make technical sense, even if they don't seem likely to be accepted.
- The title should accurately describe the content.
- The file name extension is correct (i.e. ``.md``).

- Ensure that everyone listed as a sponsor or co-author of the TEP who has write access to the `TEP repository` is added to `.github/CODEOWNERS`_.

- Skim the TEP for obvious defects in language (spelling, grammar, sentence structure, etc.), and code style reviewers may correct problems themselves, but are not required to do so (reStructuredText syntax is checked by the repo's CI).

- If a project is portrayed as benefiting from or supporting the TEP, make sure there is some direct indication from the project included to make the support clear. This is to avoid a TEP accidentally portraying a project as supporting a TEP when in fact the support is based on conjecture.

If the TEP isn't ready, an editor will send it back to the author for revision, with specific instructions.

Once the TEP is ready for the repository, a TEP reviewer from the Core-Team will:

- Assign a TEP number (almost always just the next available number.

- Check that the author has correctly labeled the TEP's type ("Standards Track", "Informational", or "Process"), and marked its status as "Draft".

- Ensure all CI build and lint checks pass without errors, and there are no obvious issues in the rendered preview output.

- Merge the new (or updated) TEP.

- Inform the author of the next steps (open a discussion thread and update the TEP with it, post an announcement to Torrust-Dev, etc).

- Updates to existing TEPs should be submitted as a `GitHub pull request`_.

- Many TEPs are written and maintained by developers with write access to the Torrust codebase.  The TEP reviewers monitor the TEP repository for changes, and correct any structure, grammar, spelling, or markup mistakes they see.

TEP reviewers don't pass judgment on TEPs. They merely do the administrative & editorial part (which is generally a low volume task).
